To Do

    √   MOB Fitness: NSGA + fitness sharing

    Fitness selection styles

    Mutation: change mutation to do the validity thing now that we have letter weight


    √   Display Solution: Display the solution in crossword format rather than the genotype
    √   Weight Letters:  Use a scrabble-like system so that we reward less-common letters being present in the GA
    √   Limit # Generations:  Add some sort of indicator so we can limit the number of generations we allow the program to run for
